CMail 0.8.2 amd64 (LibreSSL 3.1.3), Jul 17 2020

Use "cmail /?" for help.

Configuration 

CMail operates in three modes. (S)MTP mode is the default and is used when CMail is both constructing and sending an 
e-mail. (F)ile mode can be used to construct an e-mail message for subsequent delivery via either CMail or another 
application. (P)reconstructed e-mail mode is used to send e-mails constructed using File mode or another application. 
Not all settings can be used with each mode. E.g. Settings labelled SF- apply only to SMTP and File modes. 

CMail applies configuration options from a default configuration file, a command line specified configuration file, and
from the command line itself, in that order. Settings for which multiple values can be assigned (E.g. -to) are ADDED 
from each configuration. For settings that can only be specified once, the last occurrence will be used. I.e. You can 
specify a default configuration in cmail.conf, and override settings for individual messages by specifying another 
config file, or via the command line. 

Command line parameters will undergo code page conversion, unless -clutf8 is specified. Configuration files are assumed
to be UTF-8 or ASCII. 

The default configuration is stored in %APPDATA%\cmail.conf. 

Configuration files must contain one setting per line, and do not include the '-' prefix. A '#' may be used to comment 
out a line. 

Mandatory Options / Mode Selection 

-host:[user:pass@]host[:port]     S-P Specifies the SMTP server to be used to deliver the message. A username and 
                                      password may optionally be specified for SMTP authentication. Supported 
                                      mechanisms are CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, and LOGIN (in order of preference). If user 
                                      credentials are supplied, implies -starttls if authentication is not offered 
                                      prior to STARTTLS. 

-file:file                        -F- Enables (F)ile mode and specifies a filename to output the e-mail to. 

-emailfile:file                   --P Enables (P)reconstructed e-mail mode and specifies a file containing a 
                                      preconstructed e-mail for delivery via SMTP. 

-from:address[:alias]             SFP Specifies the e-mail address, with optional alias, to appear in the 'From' header
                                      of the message. This setting is required for SMTP and File modes. In 
                                      Preconstructed mode, the 'From' header will be used if this setting is omitted. 

Recipients 

-to:address[:alias[:DSN]] | @file SFP Adds a recipient in the 'To' field of the message or specifies the name of a file
                                      containing a list of recipients. This setting may be specified multiple times. 
                                      See 'Recipient Management' for more information. 

-cc:address[:alias[:DSN]] | @file SFP As above, for CC recipients. 

-bcc:address[::DSN] | @file       SFP As above, for BCC recipients. 

-reply-to:address[:alias]         SFP Specifies the e-mail address to which replies should be sent. 

Content Control 

-subject:subject text             SFP Specifies the message subject (literal string). 

-body:message body                SF- Specifies the message body. Note: '\\','\r','\n', and '\t' are valid escape 
                                      codes. 

-body-file:file[:charset]         SF- Specifies a file containing the message body. Implies -mime and -body-qp 
                                      (-body-64 may also be specified). 

-body-64                          SF- Use base64 encoding for the message body. 

-body-qp                          SF- Use quoted-printable encoding for the message body. 

-body-html:file                   SF- Specifies a file name containing a UTF-8 encoded HTML body. Attached images can 
                                      be referred to using their Content-ID if attached using -ai. 

-head:header:value                SFP Add the specified header and header value to the message. This option may be 
                                      specified multiple times. E.g. -head:X-No-Archive:Yes. 

-delhead:header                   --P Remove the specified header. This option may be specified multiple times. 

-rawhead                          --P Preserve original headers. Can be used with -head and -delhead but all other 
                                      header settings will be ignored. Non-configurable headers such as Date and 
                                      Message-ID will not be modified. 

-linelen:length                   SF- Specifies the line length for the plain text message body. The minimum and 
                                      default is 78 characters. The maximum is 998 characters. 

-mime                             SF- Force use of MIME for the message body in messages without attachments. 

-priority:n                       SFP Set the message priority to 'n', 1 = Highest, 2 = High, 4 = Low, 5 = Lowest. 

-dotstuff                         -F- Replace '.' with '..' at the start of lines. Use with third-party tools that do 
                                      not automatically do this when onsending via SMTP. 

--                                SF- Read message body from stdin. 

Attachments 

-a:file                           SF- Attach the specified file. CMail will select base64 or quoted-printable encoding 
                                      automatically. Files containing >85% ASCII text in the first 4kB will be 
                                      quoted-printable encoded. Attachments of type message/* will use 7-bit transfer 
                                      encoding for RFC compliance. 

-a64:file                         SF- Attach the specified file using base64 encoding. Attachments of type message/* 
                                      will be identified as text/plain. 

-aqp:file                         SF- Attach the specified file using quoted-printable encoding. Attachments of type 
                                      message/* will be identified as text/plain. 

-ai:file                          SF- Attach the specified file as an inline (multipart/related) attachment, usually 
                                      used for images referenced in a HTML message body. The Content-ID is file name, 
                                      URL encoded where applicable. This value is case-sensitive. Requires -body-html. 

-auu:file                         SF- Attach the specified file using uuencoding. These attachments are encoded within 
                                      the message body. 

-awild:options:pattern[/...]      SF- Attach multiple files matching one or more patterns. See 'Wildcard Attachments' 
                                      below. 

Delivery Status Notification (DSN) / Message Disposition Notification (MDN) 

-dsn:options                      S-P Specifies the default DSN types to request if no DSN settings are specified for 
                                      the recipient, using the first letter of each DSN type. Acceptable values are 
                                      (S)uccess, (F)ailure, (D)elay, and (N)ever. E.g. -dsn:SFD will request a DSN for 
                                      success, failure and delay. If (N)ever is included in the list, it will take 
                                      precedence over all other values. 

-dsnid:id                         S-P Sets the envelope ID for DSN requests. If not set, a random ID will be used. 

-mdn                              SFP Request MDN (read receipt). 

Connection Control 

-4                                S-P Force the use of IPv4. 

-6                                S-P Force the use of IPv6. 

-authtypes:type[,type...]         S-P A comma-separated list of authentication types which may be used with the 
                                      upstream server. Supported values are CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, and LOGIN. 

-helo:hostname                    S-P Use the specified hostname in HELO/EHLO. 

-proxy:[user:pass@]host[:port]    S-P Connect via a proxy. Authentication is only supported for HTTPS proxies. 

-proxytype:type                   S-P Specify the type of proxy being connected to. Supported proxy types are SOCKS 
                                      (default proxy type, default port 1080), and HTTPS (default port 8080). 

-requiretls                       S-P Require TLS be used for mail delivery. Implies -starttls. 

-starttls                         S-P Attempt to use TLS if STARTTLS is advertised in response to EHLO. 

-secureport                       S-P Specifies that the port being connected to uses SMTPS (SSL/TLS without STARTTLS).
                                      This setting changes the default port to 465. This method of securing mail 
                                      transfer is deprecated, use -starttls if the target server supports that method. 

-timeout:seconds                  S-P Sets the socket timeout. 

Debugging 

-d                                S-P Debug mode. Show data to and from the server. Passwords are not logged. 

-dd                               S-P Extended debug mode. As above but adds socket and TLS debugging information. 
                                      Passwords are not logged. 

Command Line Only 

-body-literal                     SF- Do not convert line breaks to CRLF on a message body specified using -body-file. 
                                      Implies -body-qp (-body-64 may also be specified). 

-clutf8                           SFP Assume command line parameters are UTF-8. Disables code page conversion and may 
                                      be necessary when calling CMail from within other applications. 

-encryptpass:password             --- Output an encrypted version of the specified password and exit. The encrypted 
                                      password can be used with the -host option. Encryption only provides protection 
                                      against casual password observation. 

-bindpass                         --- Encrypt password using a host-specific key. 

-config:file                      SFP Apply the configuration from the specified file. 

-nodefault                        SFP Do not apply settings from the default cmail.conf. 

-skipnofile                       SF- Do not check attachments exist before constructing e-mail. 

Recipient Management 

The -to, -cc, and -bcc settings each add either a recipient to the message or a list of recipients from file. 

When adding individual recipients, the first parameter is required and specifies an e-mail address. The second 
parameter can be used to specify an alias, usually the name of the recipient. The alias may be quoted (using double 
quotes, escaped as necessary), although this is only required where a colon may be present in the alias. The final 
parameter specifies DSN options for the recipient, using the same format as the -dsn option documented above. E.g. 
-to:user@example.com:"Example User":DF. Where an alias is not desired (or not applicable in the case of BCC), this 
field may be left blank. E.g. -bcc:user@example.com::SFD. 

When adding recipients from file, the file name must be prefixed with '@'. E.g. -to:@filename. The file should contain 
one e-mail address per line in either the form "User Alias <user@example.com>", specifying an address with an alias, or
"user@example.com" specifying only an address, both without quotes. 

When -emailfile is used, recipients will be determined by the To and Cc header fields of the preconstructed message if 
a recipient setting is not present. In all other cases, at least one recipient setting is required. 

Wildcard Attachments 

CMail supports adding multiple attachments from a source directory using patterns. Multiple patterns may be specified, 
separated by '/', and are evaluated from left to right. Patterns may include standard wildcard characters '*' or '?', 
and character sets and ranges [], and may be prefixed with a logical NOT operator '!'. In addition to the patterns, a 
number of options are available to modify the behaviour. 

Options: (Case sensitive) 

H - Include hidden files 
S - Include system files 
A - Include ONLY files with the Archive attribute set 
R - Recursive (include files in subdirectories) 
C - Case sensitive matching 
U - Use uuencoding 
6 - Use base64 encoding 
Q - Use quoted-printable encoding 
I - Create inline attachments for use with -body-html 

E.g. To recursively include logs from 1970, but exclude any .tmp files, you could do the following 
-awild:R:c:\logs\1970*/!*.tmp
